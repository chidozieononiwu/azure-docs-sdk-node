      DistributedContext represents collection of entries. Each key of

      DistributedContext is associated with exactly one value.
      DistributedContext

      is serializable, to facilitate propagating it not only inside the process

      but also across process boundaries. DistributedContext is used to annotate

      telemetry with the name:value pair Entry. Those values can be used to add

      dimension to the metric or additional contest properties to logs and
      traces.
