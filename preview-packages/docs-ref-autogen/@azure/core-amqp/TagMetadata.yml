      TagMetadata contains properties associated with a Tag.

      Anytime a sender serializes a tag, sends it over the wire and receiver

      deserializes the tag then the tag is considered to have travelled one hop.

      There could be one or more proxy(ies) between sender and receiver. Proxies

      are treated as transparent entities and they do not create additional
      hops.
