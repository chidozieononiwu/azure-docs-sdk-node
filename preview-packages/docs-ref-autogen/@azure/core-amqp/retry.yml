    summary: >
      Every operation is attempted at least once. Additional attempts are made
      if the previous attempt failed

      with a retryable error. The number of additional attempts is governed by
      the `maxRetries` property provided

      on the `RetryConfig` argument.

      If `mode` option is set to `Fixed`, then the retries are made on the

      given operation for a specified number of times, with a fixed delay in
      between each retry each time.


      If `mode` option is set to `Exponential`, then the delay between retries
      is adjusted to increase

      exponentially with each attempt using back-off factor of power 2.
