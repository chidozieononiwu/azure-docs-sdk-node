      Use the configuration object to configure MSAL and initialize the
      UserAgentApplication.

      This object allows you to configure important elements of MSAL
      functionality:

      - auth: this is where you configure auth elements like clientID, 
      authority used for authenticating against the Microsoft Identity Platform

      - cache: this is where you configure cache location and whether to store
      cache in cookies

      - system: this is where you can configure the logger, frame timeout etc.

      - framework: this is where you can configure the running mode of angular.
      More to come here soon.
    syntax:
      content: >-
        type Configuration = { auth: AuthOptions, cache: CacheOptions,
        framework: FrameworkOptions, system: SystemOptions }
    package: '@azure/abort-controller'
